# Introduction to Data Science with Python
This Repository provides an overview how to analyze data with commonly used
statistical methods in Python. Besides an general introduction to syntax and
basic operations, we will use packages like: pandas, numpy, scipy
and matplotlib. Useful cheatsheets can be downloaded: <br>

# Statistical Learning/ Machine Learning in R
>*Statistical learning theory is a framework for **machine learning**
 drawing from the fields of statistics and functional analysis.*

This repository contains exercises from a course in computational statistics, starting with simple Monte Carlo simulations to become familiar with this topic.

# Deep Learning with Python
>*A subset of machine learning modeled loosely on the neural pathways of the human brain. Deep refers to the multiple layers between the input and output layers.*
This Repository provides an example how to implement deep learning algorithms
in Python. We will first use data to train the neural network, while testing the
forecasts afterwards.

# Time Series in R
This Repository contains a basic introduction to Time Series analysis in R.
We learn how to:implement dynamic regression models, model selection & correction,
inference and produce forecasts.
